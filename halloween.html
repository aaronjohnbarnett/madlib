Who doesn't " + Verb1 + " that time of year when the weather gets " + Adj1 + " and the " + Pn1 + " start to change?</br> Halloween is a time for carving " + Pn2 + ", " + Verb_ing1 + " candy, and throwing a/an " + Adj2 + " Halloween party.</br> Halloween parties are certainly " + Adj3 + ", but preparing for them can be quite stressful. </br> However, as long as you remain cool and " + Adj4 + ", your " + Noun1 + " will be something everyone will " + Verb2 + ". </br> Most importantly, you must dress " + Adverb1 + ". Your costume must be " + Adj5 + " enough to ensure you are the " + Noun2 + " of the party. </br> Classic costumes such as vampires and " + Pn3 + " are always a hit, and keep in mind that comfort is " + Adj6 + ". This will be a " + Adj7 + " evening, and you don't want your " + BodyPart1 + " to be sore. </br> Knowing who to invite is also " + Adj8 + ". Ideally, you want " + LMM + " to be there, but if for whatever reason they can't " + Verb3 + ", " + Verb_ing2 + "... </br> at least " + PiR + " will be there. Just please make sure they don't " + Verb4 + " too much like last year! They probably should have more than " + Num + " ish " + Pn4 + " or you'll end up spending the entire party holding their " + BodyPart2 + " back as they " + Verb5 + " all over the " + Noun3 + ". </br> Keep in mind that you're the host, and other " + Pn5 + " deserve your " + Noun4 + " too. As long as you're friendly and " + Adj9 + ", provide plenty of " + Adj10 + " music, and offer delicious " + Food + ", your guests </br> will " + Verb6 + " you. IF you follow these tips, your " + Pn6 + " will " + Adverb2 + " come back in December for your " + Noun5 + " party!");
